#Excuse Randomizer
----------------------

###Overview

Excuse Randomizer is one-stop shopping for all of these people you need to give excuses too. Hahaha just kidding, I created it to introduce myself to a practical use of Python.

Users randomly generate an excuse by filling out one of the few categories.

Excuse Randomizer was developed by Mike Larkin as a fun small project to introduce myself to python.
